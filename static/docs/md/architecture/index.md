> [!concept|style:flat|label:Key Idea - Holons ]
A holon is something that is capable of functioning simultaneously as a whole and as a part of a larger whole.

In addition to working together as part of a whole, each component of PlatformKit is designed to function and provide value on its own.

This approach provides several benefits. New users can adopt incrementally. Likewise, users can also migrate away incrementally.

This mitigates risk, minimizes technical debt, and maximizes agility for the end-user.

When you separate execution from abstraction, you can iterate on your process.

This ensures that the benefits of your efforts compound exponentially.

Iterating upon your process pays the greatest dividends.

Each new insight yields better results.
