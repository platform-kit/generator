# [Concept](#concept)

In addition to working together as part of a whole, each component of PlatformKit is designed to function and provide value on its own.

This approach provides several benefits. New users can adopt incrementally. Likewise, users can also migrate away incrementally.

This mitigates risk, minimizes technical debt, and maximizes agility for the end-user.

When you separate execution from abstraction, you can iterate on your process.

This ensures that the benefits of your efforts compound exponentially.

# [Principles](#principles)

- <span style="color:black">Empower the individual by reducing their dependence on corporations, and empowering their ability to connect meaningfully with community.</span>
- <span style="color:black">Give priority to technologies such as Static Site Generators and Serverless Functions, which allow you to scale effortlessly.</span>

- <span style="color:black">Architecture decisions should create options, minimize technical debt, & increase operational agility of the user.</span>

- <span style="color:black">Whenever a decision must be made for the user (such as the choice of a UI framework), make it reversible.</span>

- <span style="color:black">Give priority to standards such as RSS, Atom, JSON, Markdown, SQL & GraphQL.</span>

- <span style="color:black">Components should work together but not depend on each other.</span>

- <span style="color:black">Businesses should be composable, iterable, & sharable.</span>
