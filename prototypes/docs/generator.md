The site generator is the part of PlatformKit that turns [static data files](/docs/models) into HTML pages based on pre-defined [templates.](/docs/generator#templates)

Even though the end-result is a static HTML file, the UI can be updated dynamically with data from an API, as shown below.

You may use any markdown-based content editor to edit the markdown files. 

For more info, see the [development guide.](/docs/development)


<div align="center">
    <img src="images/markdown-vue-html.png" style="max-width:550px;max-height:440px;"/>
</div>

# [File Structure](#file-structure)


- the `data` directory contains markdown and JSON files (your content)
- the `dist` directory contains html generated by the static site generator
- the `functions` directory contains [serverless api functions](/docs/serverless-api)
- the `lib` directory contains the core library used throughout the framework
- the `src` directory contains components for the static site generator
- the `static` directory contains static html & assets



# [Templates](#templates)

PlatformKit builds your website by combining the data found in the static files in your `data` directory with the templates found in the `src` directory. 

Each template is a Vue component contains HTML and Javascript, like so: 

```html
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  metaInfo: {
    title: 'Hello, world!',
    meta: [
      { name: 'author', content: 'John Doe' }
    ]
  }
}
</script>
```

In addition to the HTML and Javascript, a component can also contain GraphQL queries, the results of which are available to Vue.

```html
<div v-for="edge in $page.content.edges" :key="edge.node.id">
    <h2>{{ edge.node.title }}</h2>
</div>
```

```graphql
query {
  content: allContentItem {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        title
      }
    }
  }
}
```
